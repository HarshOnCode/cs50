# Scratch CS50 - Mini Contra Game

## 🎮 Game Title: *Red Falcon Showdown*

## 🧠 Game Concept:
This is a mini 2D platformer game inspired by *Contra*. Built using MIT Scratch as part of the CS50 Week 0 assignment.

## 🕹️ Storyline:
Bill Rizer steps into the jungle to destroy the evil *Red Falcon* organization.  
As he begins his mission, he says:

> “So this is the way to the Red Falcon base…”

But suddenly:

> “Wait!! Who is that?”

The main villain, **Kimkoh**, appears and says:

> "HAHAHAHA!! Look who's here Bill Rizer !! ,Surrender or pay for it!!"

Bill replies:

> “I’ve come too far to turn back now.” “Your evil ends today, Kimkoh!”

Kimkoh taunts:

> “Foolish mortal. This jungle will be your grave.” “My army awaits — let’s see how long you last.”

And from there… the action begins! 🔥
